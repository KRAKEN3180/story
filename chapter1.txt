this is the chapter 1. Which we created. 

WORKING DIRECTORY - story directory (currently in our use). [where we used git init command].

GIT STATUS : shows the files which are in the directory but not in the staging area. 

GIT ADD FILENAME : to add file to stage. (to start tracking changes in file.)

git commit -m : (-m to add a commit message)  

//commnit message is imp as it helps you keep track of what changes you have made in each commit.

git log : to check. 

git add . : to add every file in current directory to staging area.

git checkout filename : to revert back or rollback to the last position in local repository.

git diff filename : to see the difference between the last and current saved. 

git remote add origin https://github.com/rahul-sharma13/story.git : to push to github.

git push -u origin master : pushes your local repository to the remote repository using u flag(which basically links up your local and remote repository).

HERE , origin ---> Name of remote 
       master ---> Name of branch 

MASTER BRANCH ---> is your main branch of commits or save points and it is sequential . 

touch .gitignore --->

git rm --cached -r . ---> to unstage the files. 

FOR GITIGNORE - 
 	make a new file .gitignore and put the file name in it that you want to be ignored and even *.txt type commands can be used to ignore files with the extension .txt 

git branch <name> ---> to add another branch.

git checkout <name> ---> to switch the branch.
